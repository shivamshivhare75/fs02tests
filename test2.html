          <h2>Nikhil Chinapa</h2>
          <p class="para">
            To say that Nikhil Chinapa has donned many an avatar during his
            career, is like saying it snows in Alaska; a bit of an
            understatement. He morphs from DJ to VJ to MC to Music Promoter to
            Festival Director —some of his best known avatars — with amazing
            fluidity.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            He studied Architecture and graduated with a Thesis in Hospital
            Design. A year later and for reasons that scientists are still
            trying to understand, Nikhil joined MTV. He said, “I think it’ll be
            fun.” For once, he was right.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            At MTV, Nikhil has hosted almost every show the channel has aired.
            From MTV Select – MTV’s longest running show, (it aired continuously
            for 10 years) to being the host of Splitsvilla, a judge on Roadies
            as well as Rock On and now host of MTV Mashups.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            Nikhil’s Mom still thinks he’s an idiot though and should get a real
            job.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            As a popular VJ, Nikhil got to spend a lot of time around his first
            love, music. In 2001, a conversation between friends resulted in the
            launch of Submerge — India’s first, and now largest Indian
            Electronic Dance Music (EDM) company in India.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            By now, Nikhil had begun to DJ professionally and plays, well…
            whatever he feels like. His sets are moody, varied, often erratic
            but usually fun. Most of his sets feature frantic foot-stomping and
            the random flailing of arms – sometimes by him. They also feature
            music – the kind that has a repetitive monotonous beat and is best
            enjoyed at dangerous decibel levels.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            Nikhil was also the co-founder of Sunburn. He is now the Festival
            Curator and partner of Vh1 Supersonic, Goa’s brand new beach music
            festival.
